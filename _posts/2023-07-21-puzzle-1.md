Just an exercise for anyone who loves solving problems or interested in any riddles. The key to solving this is to try and keep it simple. Maybe a bit of research is required. I am interested in your steps in solving the problem rather than the exact solution. So, here's the problem

```
01110100 01101000 01101001 01110011
00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000
01101010 01110101 01110011 01110100
00100000 01100001 00100000 01100100
01101001 01110110 01100101 01110010
01110011 01101001 01101111 01101110
00100000 01101110 01101111 01110100
00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101
00100000 01100001 01100011 01110100
01110101 01100001 01101100 00100000
01101101 01100101 01110011 01110011
01100001 01100111 01100101 00101110
```

Now attempt to crack it. The riddle below contains the solution. Rather I may say, it **_is_** the solution. If you do manage to manage to arrive at the "answer" below, email me the steps you followed. It would be interesting to see how you arrived at it. If you try to work your way backwards from the solution below, then let's just say it might take a while. So anyways, here's the **_solution_**.

### Part 1
```
Woe to the defrauders!
Those who take full measure "when they buy" from people,
but give less when they measure or weigh for buyers.
Do such people not think that they will be resurrected
for a tremendous Dayâ€”
the Day "all" people will stand before the Lord of all worlds?

### Part 3
```
People were prospering. It's been five years since Eunomus got his throne.
```

So make sure to use the binary text to try and solve it. It'll be much easier that way. Alright! I think I have given more than enough clues. Stay creative and happy solving! Remember, it's the steps that matter to me, not the actual answer...
